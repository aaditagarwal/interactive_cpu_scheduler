3.	 Priority Based with/without preemption
4.	 Round Robin with a range of time quantum available
5.	 Multi-Level Queue with custom levels
6.	 Multi-Level Feedback Queue with custom levels
7.   *Also a default algorithm is provided.* 

### Output Parameters:
1.   Average Waiting Time
2.   Average Response Time
3.   Average TurnAround Time
4.   Throughput
